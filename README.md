I’m good at: devops, git+ops, iac, linux, containers, cloud, moonshots

I’m also good at: “funny” jokes, dx, scrum, strategy, system design, remote-first, backlogs

I’m bad at: documents, too many pointless meetings, bureaucracy

I like: HCL, Bash and Python. I haven't found a problem that can't be solved by these three. I can get by with most everything else if necessary. 

I don't like: proprietary solutions, lack of inner-sourcing
